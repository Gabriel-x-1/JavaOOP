1) For the given text file (Lab13_test.txt) compute how many times each word appears in the file. The output of the program (Lab13Ex1.java) should be another text file (Lab13_test_new.txt) containing on each line a word and then the number of times it appears in the original file. After you finish change the program so that the words in the output file are sorted alphabetically. Do not use maps, use only basic arrays.

2) The infinite monkey theorem states that given an infinite length of time, a chimpanzee punching at random on a typewriter would almost surely type out all of Shakespeare's plays. Let`s test it. You are given a list of 850 basic words in English in the file Lab13_basicWordsinEnglish.txt. Write a program (Lab13Ex2.java) to compose a text of 10000 words by randomly selecting words from the basic words list. Write the output in another text file Lab13_Shakespeare.txt.
